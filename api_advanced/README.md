# API Advanced

This directory contains my project submissions for the **API Advanced** module.

## Description

In this module, I explore advanced concepts and techniques related to working with APIs. I dive deeper into topics such as authentication, pagination, rate limiting, error handling, and data transformation. The projects in this directory demonstrate my understanding and application of these concepts.

## Projects

The following is an overview of the projects completed in this module:

- **Project 1:** *Authentication and Authorization*: This project focuses on implementing authentication and authorization mechanisms for API requests, ensuring secure access to protected resources.

- **Project 2:** *Pagination and Filtering*: This project involves handling large datasets by implementing pagination and filtering functionalities to retrieve specific subsets of data efficiently.

- **Project 3:** *Rate Limiting and Throttling*: This project deals with managing API usage and preventing abuse by implementing rate limiting and throttling mechanisms to control the frequency and volume of requests.

- **Project 4:** *Error Handling and Resilience*: This project focuses on handling errors gracefully and building resilient API integrations by implementing appropriate error handling strategies.

- **Project 5:** *Data Transformation and Formatting*: This project involves transforming and formatting data obtained from API responses into a desired format suitable for further processing or presentation.

Each project directory contains detailed documentation and code implementation for the respective tasks.
